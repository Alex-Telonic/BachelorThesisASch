\section{Introduction}

Explorative journey through financial filings of us commercial banks.

Different perspectives: 
	- banking sector as whole (Aggregated)
	- Median banks

Analysis timeseries and cross section

\section{Main part}

\subsection{Data}

Data from  $http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~pschnabl/data/data_callreport.htm$ ,originally from FIEC031 Reports.
Schneider adjust for variables change and so on

Timeframe: 1976Q1-2013Q4, data per year and quarter for each individual bank

We take our crisis data from the official documentation of the National Bureau of Economic Research(NBER. One can also differentiate between a so called "banking" (originated in the banking sector) vs "market" (originated from outside banking sector) crisis as in Berger and Bouwman (2013).  The assumption here is that banking crisis could be reflected stronger in the data. The crisis will be marked on the graphs as red zones.
Crisis:


\begin{itemize}
\item 1980Q1-1980Q3 early 1980s recession (market crisis)
\item 1981Q3-1982Q4 early 1980s recession (market crisis)
\item 1990Q3-1991Q2 credit crunch (banking crisis)
\item 2001Q2-2001Q4 dotcom bubble (market crisis)
\item 2007Q4-2009Q3 financial crisis (banking crisis)
\end{itemize}

Following the convention of the Federal Reserve Bulletin, banks are allocated by size into following categories:
\begin{itemize}
 \item 10 largest banks
 \item large banks (those ranked
  11 through 100)
 \item medium-sized banks (those ranked 101 through
 1,000)
 \item small banks (those ranked 1,001 and higher)
 \end{itemize} 

Other important structural events to consider:
\begin{itemize}
\item Repeal of Glass-Steagall act 
\end{itemize}

negative equity removed

Investment banks becoming commercial banks in 2009 removed

bank mergers removed by growth of assets above $40\%$

for risk analysis: commercial banks aggregated to bhcs

Values are in thousands

\subsection{Methods}


No inflation adjustment

Tranformations: Log

Timeseries analysis:

Detrending with HP Filter 1600

Deseasonalize with X11 procedure

Correlation/Autocorrelation

Significance



\subsection{General look at us banks}

The following two sections divided into assets and liabilities will guide us through the distribution of financial components held by the us commercial banks sector as a whole. We will see what the types and amounts of financial instruments banks are holding and how they evolved over time. 

\subsubsection{Assets Liabilities}

The following section will show some insights about the asset side of the whole us commercial banking sector. We want to describe and analyse how it evolved over time and find anomalies 
The typical positions a commercial bank is holding on the asset side of its balance sheet are:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Cash
 \item Fed funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell
 \item Securities
  	\begin{itemize}
 	\item Treasury
 	\item Mortage backed security
 	\item Other
 	\end{itemize}
 \item Loans net\footnote{Loans and leases net of unearned income and allowance for loan and lease losses}
 \item Trading assets
 	\begin{itemize}
 	\item Interest rate derivatives
 	\item Other fixed income
 	\item Other trading
 	\end{itemize}
 \item Other assets \footnote{composed of derivatives "not for trading" and other items}
 \end{itemize} 
 
 Every position beside the trading assets are hold "not for trading purposes". Meaning for instance the securities position and loans position are held until maturity. 
 Figure \ref{fig:assets} gives a general overview how the total assets held by all banks per year and quarter evolved over time. The value of assets rose from below 2 trillion to above 13 trillions dollars of assets. In comparison, the GDP of US in 2013 was at 16.78 trillions. We can also see a period of flatness/low growth from  year 1990-1993, a drop in 2002 and 2008/Q2. While the absolute values give us some indications of where anomalies occur, we will perform time-series analysis by decomposing the logarithmised data in trend, cyclical components. As seen within Figure \ref{fig:assets}, the value of assets has a clear trend with no indication of existing seasonality over the given timeframe. The second graph within Figure \ref{fig:assets} compares the development of assets transformed by natural logarithm to the absolute values. Both are drawn within their own vertical axis. While the growth of absolute assets is more exponential over time, the logarithm of assets grows more linear. This linear trend tells us that the relative growth rate stays constant over time. In the third part of Figure \ref{fig:assets} we can see the de-trended part of the asset timeseries. Here we can see variations that significantly differ from the trend. As mentioned in the data section the red areas show crisis periods. The alignment of crisis periods with us banks total assets variations is limited. We can see that the impact of the early 1980s recession did not lead to more volatility than other normal periods. The dotcom bubble in 2001 lead to a downward variation of us commercial banks assets away from the trend. In regards to the financial crisis in 2008 we see a huge positive variation with a rapid drop back to the trend. Assuming we have set the most fitting filtering parameters for the HP-Filter, it is interesting to see that the assets did not fall significantly below the trend. The loss was rather caused by an overheated market falling back to normal.

\label{fig:assets}
\end{figure}

Diving into more detailed analysis of the balance sheet positions, Figure \ref{fig:positions} gives us the detrended development of each individual position for both the asset(left column) and liabilities side(right column).
The cash position shows some clear spike in 2008, beside then the movements show no clear sign of irregularity. With context in mind it makes sense that banks liquidated some of their assets to increase cash. The rise in cash comes along with a significant fall in securities. Figure \ref{fig:sharepositions} showing the share of the positions further supports our thesis of sold securities to raise cash. While the share of securities fell until 2008, share of cash rose.
Trading assets follow the same behaviour as total assets in crisis 2008, but its variation in crisis periods do not significantly differ to other periods.  
Other interesting observations on the asset side, is a significant spike in

The volatility of fedfundsrepoasset increased from 1996 onwards. 
fedfundsrepoliab drops in 2002
The zero values for trading assets and liabilities are either caused because they are not reported or were not existent.

Figure 2 shows the share of each aggregated balance sheet position of all commercial banks over time. Figure 3 plots the share of each balance sheet position unstacked.\\


\noindent \textit{Key Observations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item loans make up the largest share of assets
\item share of trading assets have risen as well as interest rate derivatives
\item loans and trading assets have risen more than securities in timeframe year 2000-2009
\item Share of trading assets peaked in 2008 while securities fell.
\item There is a noticeable anomaly in year 2002. Significant amounts of repo lending is transferred into other assets. Other assets are derivatives not available for sale. 
\item drop in assets in 2002 and 2008
\item share in cash has fallen until 2008 and then increased again
\item Share of cash continously fell until 2008, and then it increased significantly again

\noindent \textit{Key Observations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Deposits as main source of funding
\item Irregularities in year 2002: repos drop while other liabilities rise
\item Irregularity in year 1983 might be caused by measuring/reporting differences
\item In 2008 share of deposits at lowest point. Although the aggregated assets peaked at that time. 
\item Deposits continuously decreased from 1990 onwards. Other financing such as "Other borrowed money" and "trading liabilities" rose
\item repos share decreased significantly until end of 2013

\end{figure}

\noindent \textit{Graph description}: The graph shows an estimation of how many banks have defaulted at a certain time (year,quarter). It is based on the negative equity recorded by banks. Hence, it is not exact and some banks might continue to exist in case of mergers or bailouts. Also sometimes banks are double counted, if a negative equity does not immediately result in bankruptcy. \\
\noindent \textit{Key Observations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item main defaults in years 1986-1991 and 2009-2011
\item long stable period from 1991-2008
\item In 1990 there were many more smaller banks. Smaller banks might have a higher likelihood to fail. In 1990:  $~74\%$ small banks, 2010: $~35\%$ small banks

\subsection{Leverage}

Throughout the analysis the definition of accounting leverage (assets/equity) is used. Equity is calculated by total assets minus total liabilities. In addition, for risk analysis banks belonging a bank holding company were aggregated. Hence, the dataset which was used contained bhcs and independent banks. Figure 21 below shows the mean, median and weighted-average leverage by asset size for each point in time. The weighted-average leverage ratio is calculated by taking into account the asset size for each bank every point in time. Every leverage ratio for each individual bank is only accounted in the weighted-average by its share of assets compared to the total assets of all banks at that point of time.

\end{figure}

\noindent \textit{Graph description}: Figures 21-25 focus on leverage ratios for every year and quarter over all banks. Banks with equity or assets below zero are excluded.


\noindent \textit{Key Observations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Extreme outliers of leverage in year 1992/93 and 2009 lead to spikes in average leverage.
\item Average-weighted leverage significantly higher from 1976 to 2004. Aligns with higher leverage of top $0.1\%$ and $1\%$ banks. Hence, the overall risk from year 1976-2004, was driven high by the larger banks. 
\item Figure 21: All banks median leverage, seasonal effect every year?
\item Leverage lowest in 2007
\item Overall Leverage did fall over time: Introduction of Basel 1 in 1988 might have lead to continuously decrease in leverage
\item Top $0.1\%$ have much higher volatility, which could just be caused by the low sample size.
\item Top $0.1\%$ and $1\%$ actually become less risky than all banks together from 2010 onwards
\item Figure 25 shows slightly negative correlation between the top $0.1\%$ banks and all banks. 
\item Crisis 2008/9: Top $0.1\%$ banks have a average leverage spike in 2008, while top $10\%$, $50\%$ and all  spike around a year later.

\section{Evaluation/Outlook}

shadow banking/investment banks not considered

off balance sheet

valuations not realistic, book values...

Applying more time-series models

Applying of models such as Regression...

Other structural events considered

significant part of trading assets still owned by non commercial banks
